## Description
When educating a diverse population of students, the ability to break down complex concepts becomes quite important. After working closely with The Knowledge Houseâ€™s students and his son Elijah <i class="em em-baby"></i>, Heriberto Roman, an Instructor at The Knowledge House, realized a consistent problem that existed with his adult students, elementry student [Elijah], and once himself as a code newbie: the problem of being inundated with new difficult, <i class="em em-male-technologist"></i> technical concepts and not being able to process and retain them <i class="em em-thinking_face"></i>.

Heriberto set out to come up with a solution that can support code newbies across the nation <i class="em em-raised_hands"></i>.

cThink (computational thinking) is a progressive web app that focuses on the abstraction piece of the computational thinking model. This platform allows students to utilize the Draw, Act, Build {D.A.B.} pedagogy and helps them retain complex coding concepts by associating them with personalized analogies, building them out, and saving their process.
